Simple bond pricing tool, hopefully building towards an IRS pricer. 

Used the Tkinter code from exploringfinance.com/bond-price-python/ and reworked the formulae

To use the application, make sure Python is downloaded on your device and download the start.py file from this repo,
Then go to your terminal and type "python" and then the location of the file 
e.g. python C:\Users\yourname\Documents\bond-pricer\start.py
